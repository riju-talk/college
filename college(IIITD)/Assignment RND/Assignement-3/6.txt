Advantages of using OO
1. Easy to gather smaller data.
2. Easy to manipulate data by creating methods.

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. Easy to organise data in a large amount.
2. Less time taking in traversing due to hashing.

Disadvantages of using OO
1. Difficult to add attributes and data associated to it.
2. This appraoch is quite abstract, considering that we can't know the state of object but we can print a dictionary to know the state.

Disadvantages of using Dictionaries
1. Initializing a dictioanry 
2. Easy to gather smaller data

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 1000
2. Time by OO: 0.010997533798217773 
3. Time by dictionary: 0.010997533798217773 
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 0.0
