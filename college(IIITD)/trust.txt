2. Given the start time and the end time (in 24hr format, both inclusive) as input, determine all the students who entered the campus during this, and all students who exited the campus during this time. Save the result into an output text file, with the format similar as the input data file.
3. Given the gate number (as input), determine the number of times students have entered the campus through that gate, and the number of times students have exited the campus from that gate.
